# How Badly Will You Lose – League of Legends  
### DSC 80 Final Project – Spring 2025  
By: Ziyan Liu

## Introduction

This project uses professional League of Legends match data from [Oracle’s Elixir](https://oracleselixir.com/match-data/), which contains detailed post-game statistics from major competitive leagues such as the LCS, LEC, LCK, and LPL. The dataset includes **150,588 rows and 163 columns**, with each row representing a single player's performance in a match.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a game was a “stomp” — defined here as a short match (less than 25 minutes) in which one team had a gold lead of at least 1500 at 15 minutes and went on to win, or was behind by that much and lost. Stomps are meaningful because they showcase overwhelming early-game dominance and can reveal patterns in team strategy and execution.

To answer this question, we focus on a subset of early and mid-game features, such as gold, XP, and CS differences at 10 and 15 minutes; kills, assists, and deaths at the same intervals; early objective control (`firstblood`, `firstdragon`, `firstherald`, `firsttower`); and combat impact metrics like `visionscore`, `dpm` (damage per minute), and `damagetakenperminute`. The target column, `is_stomp`, is a binary label derived from game length, result, and gold differential at 15 minutes.

## Data Cleaning 

To prepare the dataset for analysis, I performed several data cleaning steps to ensure consistency and reliability. First, I loaded the full 2022 Oracle’s Elixir League of Legends dataset, which originally contained 150,588 rows and 163 columns. I selected a subset of 23 relevant columns related to early- and mid-game performance, objective control, and combat impact. These features were chosen to align with the data generating process for “stomps” — games that are short and heavily one-sided by 15 minutes.

Next, I handled missing values by replacing placeholder entries such as `'NULL'`, empty strings, `'na'`, and `'NA'` with pandas' `NA` value. This step was necessary because in data scraped from various match logs, incomplete values are often represented inconsistently. I then filtered the dataset to include only rows where the `datacompleteness` column indicated `'complete'`, ensuring that only full and valid records were used. I also removed duplicate rows to avoid biasing the model with repeated match data.

Finally, I created a new binary column `is_stomp`, which labels a match as a “stomp” if it lasted under 25 minutes (i.e., less than 1500 seconds) and if the team either had a gold lead of 1500+ and won, or had a deficit of 1500+ and lost by 15 minutes. This column serves as the prediction target for the project.
